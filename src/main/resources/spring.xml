  Spring Bean Configuration File — Constructor Injection + Autowire Demo
  ============================================================================

  This XML file defines Spring bean configurations demonstrating:
  - Setter Injection     : Spring calls setXxx() methods to inject values
  - Constructor Injection: Spring calls the matching constructor with values
                           (commented out below — switch to try it)
  - Autowire             : Spring automatically injects matching beans
                           without needing explicit <property ref="..."/>

  Key Concepts:
  - Beans            : Objects managed by the Spring IoC container
  - Constructor Injection : Spring calls the matching constructor and passes values
  - Setter Injection : Spring calls setter methods after creating the bean
  - Scope            : Controls how many instances Spring creates
                       singleton (default) = 1 shared instance
                       prototype           = new instance every time
  - Autowire         : Spring automatically resolves and injects bean dependencies
                       byType  = match by the type of the property (used here)
                       byName  = match by the name of the property = bean id

         BEAN 1: Alien — Setter Injection + Autowire
         ================================================================

         ID    : "alien"
         Class : org.example.Alien
         Scope : SINGLETON (default) — only ONE instance for entire application

         autowire="byType":
         - Spring looks at Alien's properties needing injection.
         - It finds `Computer com` (via setCom setter).
         - It scans all beans and finds Laptop which implements Computer.
         - Spring automatically injects the Laptop bean into `com`.
         - No need to write <property name="com" ref="..."/> manually.

         ACTIVE: Setter Injection for `age`
         - Spring calls no-arg constructor first, then setAge(10).

         COMMENTED OUT: Constructor Injection
         - Uncomment <constructor-arg> lines to use 2-arg constructor instead.
         - Spring would call: new Alien(50, laptopBean)
         - Comment out <property name="age" value="10"/> when using constructor injection.

         ================================================================ -->
    <bean id="alien" class="org.example.Alien" autowire="byName">

        <!-- Setter Injection: Spring calls setAge(10) after no-arg constructor -->
        <property name="age" value="10"/>

        <!-- WITHOUT autowire you MUST manually write this line to inject com:
             <property name="com" ref="com"/>
             Spring will NOT inject it on its own — you have to tell it explicitly.
             With autowire="byName" or autowire="byType", this line is NOT needed.
             Spring handles it automatically. -->

        <!-- autowire="byName"  → Spring looks at the SETTER METHOD name, NOT the field name.
                                  setter is setCom() → strips "set" → lowercases → looks for bean id="com"
                                  IMPORTANT: even if the field is renamed to com1, the setter is still setCom()
                                  so Spring still looks for bean id="com", NOT "com1".
                                  field name is IRRELEVANT for byName — only the setter name matters.
             autowire="byType"  → Spring matches the field type Computer to a bean that implements it
                                  PROBLEM: if 2 beans implement Computer (Laptop + Desktop both registered),
                                  Spring finds both and throws NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException (ambiguous)
                                  SOLUTION: use byName, or remove one of the beans, or comment one out -->

        <!-- Constructor Injection alternative (comment out property above if using this): -->
        <!-- <constructor-arg value="50"/> -->
        <!-- <constructor-arg ref="com"/> -->

    </bean>

    <!-- ================================================================
         SINGLETON vs PROTOTYPE Scope
         ================================================================

         SINGLETON (default):
         Alien obj1 = context.getBean("alien");
         Alien obj2 = context.getBean("alien");
         obj1 == obj2  →  TRUE (same object reused)

         PROTOTYPE (uncomment below to try):
         Alien obj1 = context.getBean("alien1");
         Alien obj2 = context.getBean("alien1");
         obj1 == obj2  →  FALSE (new object each time)

         Use Cases:
         - Singleton  : Stateless beans — services, controllers, repositories
         - Prototype  : Stateful beans — objects that hold user-specific data

         ================================================================ -->
    <!-- <bean id="alien1" class="org.example.Alien" scope="prototype"/> -->

    <!-- ================================================================
         BEAN 2: Laptop — Dependency for Alien
         ================================================================

         ID    : "com"
         Class : org.example.Laptop
         Scope : SINGLETON (default)

         - Laptop implements the Computer interface.
         - Spring injects this bean into Alien's `Computer com` field.
         - autowire="byType" on Alien finds this bean because
           Laptop's type satisfies the Computer interface type.
         - bean id="com" also makes autowire="byName" work
           (matches the field name `com` in Alien).

         lazy-init="true":
         ================
         WHAT IT IS:
         By default, Spring creates ALL singleton beans at startup (eager init).
         lazy-init="true" tells Spring: "Don't create this bean at startup.
         Create it only when it is first requested/needed."

         WHAT HAPPENS WITHOUT lazy-init (default = false):
         - Spring starts → immediately creates Laptop bean → keeps it ready
         - Even if your code never uses it, it is still created

         WHAT HAPPENS WITH lazy-init="true":
         - Spring starts → Laptop bean is NOT created yet
         - Only when something asks for it (e.g. Alien needs it via autowire),
           Spring creates it at that moment

         WHEN TO USE:
         - Bean is heavy to create (DB connection, file reader, external API client)
           and you don't want it created unless actually needed
         - App has many beans but only a few are used in every run
         - You want faster startup time

         WHEN NOT TO USE:
         - Bean is always needed → lazy-init just delays the cost, no benefit
         - You want startup to fail fast if a bean has a config error
           (with lazy-init, the error only shows up when the bean is first used,
           not at startup — harder to catch early)

         NOTE: lazy-init only applies to SINGLETON beans.
         PROTOTYPE beans are always lazy by nature (created only on request).

         ================================================================ -->
    <bean id="com1" class="org.example.Laptop" lazy-init="true"/>
    <bean  class="org.example.Desktop" />

</beans>
