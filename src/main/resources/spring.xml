    <!--
        lazy-init="true"
        ================
        WHAT IT IS:
        By default, Spring creates ALL singleton beans at startup (eager init).
        lazy-init="true" tells Spring: "Don't create this bean at startup.
        Create it only when it is first requested/needed."

        WHAT HAPPENS WITHOUT lazy-init (default = false):
        - Spring starts → immediately creates Laptop bean → keeps it ready
        - Even if your code never uses it, it is still created

        WHAT HAPPENS WITH lazy-init="true":
        - Spring starts → Laptop bean is NOT created yet
        - Only when something asks for it (e.g. Alien needs it via autowire),
          Spring creates it at that moment

        WHEN TO USE:
        - Bean is heavy to create (DB connection, file reader, external API client)
          and you don't want it created unless actually needed
        - App has many beans but only a few are used in every run
        - You want faster startup time

        WHEN NOT TO USE:
        - Bean is always needed → lazy-init just delays the cost, no benefit
        - You want startup to fail fast if a bean has a config error
          (with lazy-init, the error only shows up when the bean is first used,
          not at startup — harder to catch early)

        NOTE: lazy-init only applies to SINGLETON beans.
        PROTOTYPE beans are always lazy by nature (created only on request).
